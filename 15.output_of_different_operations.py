#Lab_Excersie_2
#Q.15 What will be the output of the following if a =2, b=3, c =4, d = 3?

# a) a == b
# ANS:it will print false as a and b are not equal
# b) a != d
# ANS:it will print true as a and d are not equal.
# c) b == d
# ANS:it will print true as b and d are both same.
# d) a != c
# ANS:it will print true as a and c are not equal.
# e) a += c
# ANS:it will add c to a and store the value to a and it will print 6.
# f) b /= d
# ANS:it will divide b by d and store the value to b.It will print 1
# g) b > a
# ANS:it will display true as b is greater than 2.
# h) a < d
# ANS:it will display true as a is smaller than d.
# i) b-a == c-b
# ANS:it will display true as difference of b and a is equal to difference to c and b.
# j) b >= d
# ANS:it will display true b is equal to d. 

a=2
b=3
c=4
d=3

print(a == b)
print(a != d)
print(b == d)
print(a != c)
print(b > a)
print(a < d)
print(b-a == c-b)
print(b >= d)

a+=c
print(a)
b /= d
print(b)
